# Xim

Xim is a suite of simulators that can help you test your code in isolation before it reaches production. Xim is designed to use fluent language and structured approach, so writing your simulation is easy and intuitive.

## Features

Xim allows you to create RESTful api simulators using HTTP protocol and Service Bus simulators using AMQP protocol.

The simulators run in memory only and do not depend on other external resources. Therefore this suite is useful if you need to test your code in isolation.

With Xim, you can do the following:

- Simulate any HTTP/S API
- Simulate Azure Blob Storage
- Simulate Azure Service Bus

Xim supports secure connections using SSL certificate.
